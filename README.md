# Casey's Quiz Game

https://hyne-os1.github.io/Casey-s-API-Quiz/

## Description

 * My inital motivation for this project was to create a simple quiz that responds to the right and wrong answers of multiple choice questions.

 * The construction of this project was to create a simple website that when started a timer begins and multiple choice questions are to be answered, wrong answers provided to be penalised with a 1 minute deduction to your time limit.

 * Creating a simple code base with frequent use of comments makes for an easier user experience aswell as a good play for future reference.

 * Taking on this project was challenging but at the same time provided a better understanding of the way to use functions properly and how each variable coincides with one another.

## Usage

Using the website is very straightforward simply press the start button for the quiz to begin and the timer will start.
